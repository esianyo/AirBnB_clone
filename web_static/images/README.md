### images Directory

The "images" directory is where we store all the image files used in our website. Images play a crucial role in enhancing the visual appeal of web pages.

**File Structure**:

- `logo.png`: This image file contains our website's logo, which is displayed in the header.

- `background.jpg`: The "background.jpg" image serves as the background for certain sections of our website.

- `gallery/`: This subdirectory contains a collection of images used in our image gallery. You can organize and name them as per your requirements.

**Usage**:

You can add, replace, or modify images in this directory as needed for your project. When referencing images in your HTML documents or CSS styles, use the appropriate file paths to ensure they display correctly.

Please maintain a well-organized structure within the "images" directory to make it easier to manage and reference images throughout your project..
